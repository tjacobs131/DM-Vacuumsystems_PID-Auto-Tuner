Write recommendation for OOP implementation
Class diagram for simulation and OOP implementation

# Test setup
[x] Plot data
[] Implement noise measurement
[] Measure optimal controller output based on setpoint
[x] Store measured system dynamics
[] Allow user to change tc during operation

# Final system
[] Measure baseline noise
[] Measure controller output for setpoint
[] Calculate appropriate step / relay test setpoint and amplitude
[] Measure system dynamics
[] Store system dynamics
[] System recommends possible parameter values
[] User enters optional parameter
[]     Recalculate PID variables
[] System test
