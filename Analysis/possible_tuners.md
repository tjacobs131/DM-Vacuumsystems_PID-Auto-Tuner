Ziegler–Nichols
    - Requires dead time to be less than 0.5x time constant
    - Requires large overshoot over actual target temperature

Åström–Hägglund

Cohen–Coon
    - Requires dead time to be less than 2x time constant
    - Requires overshoot over lower target temperature than actual
    - Requires a linear process variable
