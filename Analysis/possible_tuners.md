Traditional PID Tuning Methods
Ziegler–Nichols Method
Requirements:
Requires the process dead time to be less than about 0.5× the time constant.
Typically produces a large overshoot relative to the target (e.g., in heating systems).
Generally yields aggressive PID settings; the resulting tuning may be less “accurate” (or too oscillatory) compared to more modern methods.
Test Methods:
Bump (Step) Test: An open‑loop step change is applied to record the reaction curve and extract process gain, dead time, and time constant.
Relay Method: A relay test forces a limit cycle oscillation so that the ultimate gain (K₋u) and oscillation period (T₋u) can be measured.
Estimated Tuning Time:
Step Test: One open‑loop step test takes roughly 7 hours for a heating process (plus minimal computation).
Relay Test: Forcing oscillations requires 2–3 full cycles. If you count only the heating period (about 7 hours per cycle), the total is roughly 14–21 hours; if you count the complete cycle (≈17 hours per cycle), it can be 34–51 hours.

Åström–Hägglund Method
Characteristics:
Requires little prior process knowledge.
Avoids loop instability by keeping the controller output from saturating.
Ideally produces square-wave oscillations (in practice these are approximated).
Later extensions address issues such as sluggish response and excessive derivative action.
Test Method:
Relay Auto-tuning: Uses a controlled relay test to generate a safe limit cycle, yielding data for parameter estimation.
Estimated Tuning Time:
Uses a safe relay test to force oscillations, with an estimated duration of approximately 15–20 hours (over 2–3 cycles).
Cohen–Coon Method
Requirements:
Requires that the process dead time is less than about 2× the time constant.
Relies on having a measurable overshoot (typically relative to a lower target temperature than the actual setpoint).
Assumes the process can be well approximated by a first‑order model (without integrators).
Test Method:
Step (Bump) Test: A step change is applied to capture the reaction curve; process gain, dead time, and time constant are derived to compute the tuning equations.
Estimated Tuning Time:
Based on a single open‑loop step test, typically about 7 hours (or 7–17 hours if cooling periods are required between tests).

Lambda Tuner / Internal Model Control (IMC)
Characteristics:
Derived from Åström–Hägglund ideas.
Applicable only to PI controllers (ignores derivative action).
Produces a slower, more conservative response, which is robust against errors in dead time estimation and process variations.
Test Methods:
Bump (Step) Test: Measures process gain, dead time, and time constant.
The user selects a desired closed‑loop time constant (λ), usually between one and three times the process time constant.
Lambda tuning equations (with integral time set equal to the process time constant) are then applied.
Estimated Tuning Time:
Requires only the step test to identify the process model; estimated time is roughly 7 hours.

Simple Control Rule (SIMC)
Characteristics:
Introduces an extra tuning parameter, set by the operator, to adjust the closed‑loop speed.
Particularly effective for time‑delayed processes.
Test Method:
Step (Bump) Test: A simplified first‑order plus dead time model is derived from the step test; the extra parameter allows the operator to modify response speed.
Estimated Tuning Time:
Similar to other step‑test methods; typically approximately 7 hours per test.
Tyreus–Luyben Method
Characteristics:
Provides less aggressive (more conservative) controller settings compared to Ziegler–Nichols.
Favors stability and yields reduced overshoot and oscillatory behavior.
Test Method:
Step (Bump) Test: The process reaction curve is used in Tyreus–Luyben’s specific tuning formulas.
Oscillation-based data (from relay tests) may also be used with different scaling rules.
Estimated Tuning Time:
Based on a single step test; roughly about 7 hours per test.
Modern PID Tuning Methods
Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO)
Overview:
A modern, optimization-based approach inspired by the cooperative hunting strategy of Harris’ hawks.
Belongs to population-based metaheuristic algorithms, exploring the PID parameter space by iteratively evaluating candidate solutions.
Characteristics:
Capable of handling nonlinear and complex process dynamics by evaluating multiple candidate solutions simultaneously.
May offer improved performance (e.g., lower overshoot, faster settling) compared to traditional methods in systems with highly variable behavior.
Test Method:
Iterative Optimization: The algorithm iteratively adjusts PID settings using a performance metric (such as minimizing integral error, overshoot, or settling time) until near-optimal parameters are found.
Estimated Tuning Time:
Typically involves multiple full cycles. Reported estimates range from roughly 48–72 hours (with fewer cycles) up to about 170 hours if each iteration requires a full 17‑hour cycle.
Example Source:

Neural Network Approach
Overview:
Uses machine learning to model the relationship between process dynamics and optimal PID parameters.
Can be trained offline with historical or simulation data or adapt online through continuous learning.
Characteristics:
Capable of adapting to nonlinear behaviors and uncertainties.
Offers potential for self-tuning and real‑time adjustment.
Test Method:
Model Training and Validation: A neural network is trained using process data (from simulations or actual measurements) to predict PID gains.
The predicted parameters are iteratively refined against performance criteria (such as response time, overshoot, and stability).
Estimated Tuning Time:
Training typically requires several cycles (often 3–5 cycles) of data collection, estimated at around 20–40 hours.
Without prior data, full-cycle training might take up to about 170 hours; however, once trained, inference (or one‑shot tuning) occurs in milliseconds.

Swarm Learning
Overview:
Employs swarm intelligence algorithms (e.g., Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization) to collaboratively search for optimal PID parameters.
Inspired by natural swarm behaviors, this method leverages distributed problem solving.
Characteristics:
Excels in exploring large, multidimensional parameter spaces and escaping local optima.
Particularly useful for complex, nonlinear, or multi‑modal control problems.
Test Method:
Swarm-Based Optimization: Multiple candidate solutions are evaluated simultaneously based on a performance index (such as integrated absolute error), and the swarm converges toward optimal PID settings.
Estimated Tuning Time:
Typically requires evaluation over several cycles. Reported durations are on the order of 5–7 days (roughly 120–168 hours in real‑time operation).

Iterative Feedback Tuning (Gradient Descent Method)
Overview:
A data‑driven approach that tunes PID parameters based on measured closed‑loop performance, without requiring an explicit process model.
Particularly useful for multivariable systems.
Characteristics:
Aims for minimal overshoot with a fast response to setpoint changes.
Standard implementation requires (#inputs × #outputs) cycles; randomized variants can reduce this number.
Test Method:
Iterative Update: PID parameters are adjusted iteratively using gradient-descent–like updates derived from experimental data.
Estimated Tuning Time:
For SISO systems, typical estimates are around 3–5 iterations totaling approximately 50 hours per heating zone.
With randomized optimization, this might reduce to 10–20 iterations with partial heating, approximately 8–14 hours.
