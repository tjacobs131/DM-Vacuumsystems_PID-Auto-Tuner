1. As a Process Engineer, I want to run the auto tuner once on a new system so that I can determine stable PID settings without spending hours manually adjusting them.

2. As a Maintenance Engineer, I want to run the tuner after a major system update or repair so that I can ensure the PID settings are still optimal.
